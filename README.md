# MAGIC-2022-Saving-Memories

Magic '22 Summer Project

# Topic

- My topic is how social isolation for the elderly during the pandemic triggered depression, which sequentially caused a rise in dementia and Alzheimer’s.
- This is a website to help seniors with depression, dementia, and Alzheimer’s to save and cultivate treasured memories with their loved ones in a consolidated, user-friendly platform while being able to learn more about the diseases and how to combat them.

# Website Layout:

- Home page 
- Resources page to learn about depression, dementia, Alzheimer’s, and its correlation 
- An activity page where patients can log their memories in a diary type of form format to remember better 
- About me page 
- Blog page in the works
