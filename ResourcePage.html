  <h2>What is depression?</h2>
  <h3 style="font-weight: 200;">Clinical depression, also known as major depression, is an illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts. Clinical depression affects the way you eat and sleep. It affects the way you feel about yourself and those around you. It even affects your thoughts. There is mounting evidence that clinical depression takes a serious toll on physical health. Results have shown that people with major depression who are recovering from strokes or heart attacks have a more difficult time making health care choices. Patients with major depression have a higher risk of death in the first few months after a heart attack. Depression carries a high risk of suicide. This is the worst but very real outcome of untreated or under-treated depression.
</h3>
  <h3  style="font-weight: 200;">However, it can be healed.  More than 80% of people with clinical depression can be successfully treated with early recognition, intervention, and support. If you have any symptoms that align with the ones listed below, please seek medical assistance and treatment immediately. 
</h3>
  <ul id="DepressionSymptoms">
    <li>Change in sleep problems</li>
    <li>Insomnia </li>
    <li>Excessive energy loss</li>
    <li>Sudden need for sleep </li>
    <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</li>
    <li>feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, and irritability</li>
  </ul>
    <h2>How is depression correlated to dementia and the elderly?</h2>
    <h3  style="font-weight: 200;">Even before COVID-19, about one-quarter of Americans over age 65 were socially isolated, and more than 40 percent of people over age 60 reported feeling lonely. 
The pandemic’s arrival left elderly people who lived alone even more isolated than before, and cut off those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities from family and friends, as facilities closed their doors to visitors in an attempt to protect residents. Family members of residents advocated from opposite directions — some arguing that their loved ones were dying from the isolation and that they needed visits, while other families urged the facilities not to let anyone in. The elderly are also extremely high risk to the pandemic so they had to quarantine home away from all of their family, which drastically negatively affected their mental health. The pandemic also raised technology dependence, and a reliance on technology has a tendency to make us feel more lonely than without it. 
</h3>
    <h3  style="font-weight: 200;">There is also evidence proving that depression causes dementia. A study published in the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry found that people who became depressed late in life had a 70% increased risk of dementia, and those who'd been depressed since middle age were at 80% greater risk. Also, it was published that Harvard Health researchers have long known that depression and dementia go hand in hand. Yet they've debated over whether the two conditions simply share common causes, or whether depression is an early sign of dementia. Both theories appear to be true. The authors of the study also say depression late in life may indicate that changes have occurred in the brain that can make us more prone to developing dementia.

  <h2>Now let's learn about dementia.</h2>
  <h3  style="font-weight: 200;">So, what is dementia? Dementia is not a single condition. it is caused by different physical diseases of the brain, for example Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, DLB and FTD. It categorizes conditions that affect thinking and social skills that affect daily functioning. There are multiple stages of dementia. In the first stage, it is not very well known to the person who experiences it, and is called “mild dementia”, since only a small part of the brain is damaged. As dementia progresses into middle or later stages, the symptoms become more clear depending on what type of dementia they have. Over time, the disease spreads to more parts of the brain, leading more parts of the brain to be unable to function while already affected parts become worse.  
The disease progresses differently by age (the older the slower) and progresses slowly for those suffering from Alzheimer’s.
</h3>
    <h3  style="font-weight: 200;">There are various conditions within dementia. Here are some examples:</h3>
  
  <ul id="TypesOfDementia">
    <li><em>Vascular Dementia</em>- This is caused by a lack of blood flow in the brain. The main symptoms include confusion and disorientation, difficulty concentrating, vision problems and hallucinations.
</li>
    <li><em>Lewy Body Dementia</em>- protein deposits in nerve cells
Interrupts chemical messages in the brain, causes memory loss and disorientation, disturbed sleep schedule, loss of body functionality
</li>
    <li><em>Parkinson’s Disease</em>- This condition is identifiable by loss of reasoning and judgement. Advanced Parkinson’s can transition into dementia, where the patient has trouble understanding how to do daily tasks, hallucinates, suffers from depression and paranoia, and has trouble speaking.
</li>
    <li><em>Frontotemporal Dementia</em>- This condition is where the front and side parts of the brain are affected. Also known as Pick’s disease, this condition affects language and behavior, sparks loss of motivation and knowledge of words, and affects people young as 45 years old.</li>
    <li><em>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</em>- This is the rarest and most fatal form of dementia. 1 in 1 million people are diagnosed per year, but this condition (also calleed CJD) progresses fast- people often die within an year of diagnosis, after suffering from symptoms such as twitching and muscle stiffness, agitation, depression, confusion, and memory loss.
</li>
<em>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome</em>- This condition is identifiable by the lack of Vitamin B-1, bleeding in lower parts of the brain, double vision and loss of physical coordination. When Wernicke syndrome disappears, Korsakoff appears, so it isn't two conditions at once, but rather a cause-and-effect type correlation. If you are diagnosed with the syndrome, you will have difficulty processing information, learning new skills, or remembering things, and will need to often make up things to fill memory gaps as a result of chronic infection or malnutrition
</li>
    <li><em>Mixed Dementia</em>- This condition is when there is many forms of dementia in one person. Up to 45% of people who have this condition are unaware they have this condition since there are different symptoms per person- mixed symptoms of what types of dementia they experience.
</li>
    <li><em>Normal pressure hydrocephalus</em>- This condition is identifiable by excess fluid in the ventricles. This is also known as Pick’s disease, and it affects language and behavior, causes loss of motivation and knowledge of words, and affects people as young as 45 years old. 
</li>
    <li><em>Huntington’s disease</em>- This is a genetic condition causing dementia. Juvenile Huntington's Disease tends to be rarer and causes symptoms in childhood Onset Huntington's Disease symptoms start when one's age is 30 or 40.
General symptoms of Huntington's include having difficulty focusing, decreased impulse control, inability to speak clearly, difficulty learning new things, and a premature breakdown of nerve cells.
</li>
    <h2>How can we help the elderly with this condition or to prevent this condition?</h2>
  </ul>
  <li><em>Calling and Interacting with Seniors</em>- Loss of social interaction is correlated with dementia. Results indicated that markers of poor social engagement, including living alone, having a limited social network, infrequent social contact and inadequate social support, all increased dementia risk
Results also indicated that the risk of dementia increased when poor social engagement was coupled with depression
Because depression rates within the elderly community  have been rising due to the pandemic, and we know depression is caused by dementia, we need to keep continuously contact them to not have them feel isolated. Seniors have spent their entire life giving to us, and now, post-retirement to elderly age is when they are supposed to enjoy and look back on their lives, not fall ill. So, we must give back and support them.

</li>
<li><em>Music (singing/instrument) and dancing</em>-Research shows profound positive impacts from music therapy and various forms of musical stimulation. Certain types of music can help trigger memories and support feelings of happiness.</li>
  <li><em>Gardening</em>- This activity arouses the senses and gives the elderly senior in your life a chance to soak in some critical Vitamin D. For more physically able seniors, there’s the added benefit of exercise </li>
  <li><em>Walking and exercising</em>-Help your elderly loved one get those endorphins flowing with some form of physical activity. Getting some outdoors time is essential!</li>
  <li><em>Higher Learning</em>- This is a superb way to maintain mental alertness and engagement, and gives a refresher and motivator for the elderly to exercise their brain muscles, crucial to preventing dementia. This also includes reading, writing, etc. </li>
