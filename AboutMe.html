	<h3 style="font-weight: 200;">Hi! My name is Jade Yoo and I am a rising 9th grader at Menlo School. I've always felt a deep passion for helping the elderly. I am a competitive dancer and I do debate, Model UN, Choir, and love participating in school clubs and sports. <h3>
    
      <h3 style="font-weight: 200;">My grandma was an opera singer and music lecturer in Korea and she used to run classes for the elderly before the pandemic. However, the pandemic hit and she wasn’t able teach anymore because of new restrictions against the spread of covid-19 and seniors, who her classes were for, were among the most high risk during the pandemic. My grandma became sad and lonely alongside countless other of seniors. Luckily, she has my aunt to take care of her in Korea. However, not many were as lucky as her, and fell prey to depression then dementia. I also have a great grandma on my dad’s side who’ve suffered and eventually lost to dementia. I’ve heard firsthand how scary the condition is. This is a relevant and urgent issue that needs to be solved, and I want to take as much action I can to make my own change, no matter how small or big.  </h3> </body>
