	<h2>Hi! Welcome to Saving Memories!</h2>
	<h3 style="font-weight: 200;">We are a website to help seniors with depression, dementia, and Alzheimer’s to save and cultivate treasured memories with their loved ones in a consolidated, user-friendly platform while being able to learn more about the diseases and how to combat them.</h3> <img src="https://devotedguardians.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/at-what-point-is-a-person-considered-elderly-980x400.jpg" alt="Seniors" style="width:350px; height:270px;  padding: 10px;" id="ElderlyCouple"> <img src="https://images.everydayhealth.com/images/how-to-cope-with-anxiety-and-depression-722x406.jpg" alt="Depression" style="width:350px; height:270px;  padding: 10px;" id="Depression" /> <img src="https://www.science.org/do/10.5555/article.2438786/abs/1280x720shutterstock_1111126898.jpg" alt="Alzheimer's: a form of dementia" style="width:350px; height:270px;  padding: 10px;" id="ErasingBrain" />
  <h2>“Though those with Alzheimer’s might forget us, we as a society must remember them" -Scott Kirshenbaum</h2>
	<h3 style="font-weight: 200;">Alzheimer’s currently affects 40 million people across the globe, and if left without a cure, will affect 150 million people in 2050. It’s the most expensive disease, but the cost will increase by fivefold by 2050. Today, it’s among the top 10 causes of death worldwide, but is the only one we can’t cure. Clinical depression is also a terrifying and dangerous condition, which skyrocketed post-pandemic. Even before COVID-19, about 1/4 of Americans over age 65 were socially isolated, and more than 40% over age 60 reported feeling lonely. The pandemic’s arrival left seniors alone and cut off those in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, as facilities closed their doors to visitors to protect residents. People who became depressed late in life had a 70% increased risk of dementia, and those who'd been depressed since middle age were at 80% greater risk.</h3> 
  <h3 style="font-weight: 200;">Obviously, this is an extremely urgent issue. This website is my attempt to make my version of change, no matter how small or big. There is information about the conditions on the page, a place where patients will be able to log their memories to help remember them better, an about me page, and a blog which is incomplete, but in the works as time progresses. </h3>
